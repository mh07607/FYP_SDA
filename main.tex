\section{Introduction}
This document outlines the Software Design Specification (SDS) for the Real-Time Safety Monitoring System designed for Dawlenceâ€™s sheet metal plant in Karachi. It expands upon the system requirements specified in the SRS document by describing how the software requirements will be implemented. This SDS will provide a detailed overview of the system architecture, data model, data pipeline, and technical implementation.

\section{Project Architecture (30 Points)}
\subsection{System Overview}
The system comprises the following major components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CCTV Cameras:} Capture real-time footage across factory zones.
    \item \textbf{YOLO Models:} Process video frames for safety hazard detection.
    \item \textbf{Backend Server:} Coordinates communication between system components and manages data storage.
    \item \textbf{Web-Based Dashboard:} Visualizes hazard notifications and safety analytics.
    \item \textbf{Notification System:} Delivers alerts via dashboard, email, and SMS.
\end{itemize}

    \caption{System Block Diagram}
\end{figure}
Fig.1  shows how inputs and outputs are processed through the system.
The system recieves input from CCTV cameras, processes it through the YOLO models, 
and stores the data in the backend server. The web-based dashboard visualizes an annotated
view of the CCTV input (annotations done by deep learning models) as well as
presents the user with statistics of past hazard detections (created using stored data) 
The notification system alerts relevant personnel of any detected hazards. Currently, the notification system is an automated
email to the supervisor as well as a desktop notification to the dashboard user.

    \caption{System Flow Diagram}
\end{figure}
Fig.2 shows a more detailed view of each detection and when they're triggered. 
Once our system recieves the CCTV footage, YOLO models analyse it frame by frame
to detect the presence and location (in pixel coordinates) of people, forklifts,
bare hands, and obstacles. 

The models detect the following objects (for the given reasons):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{People:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fall detection
        \item Entry of restricted areas
        \item Safe distance between forklift and workers
        \item Improper machinery usage (e.g., standing on conveyor belts)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Forklifts:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Speeding
        \item Proximity to workers
        \item Adherence to designated paths
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bare Hands:} To check for PPE compliance.
    \item \textbf{Obstacles:} To check for path obstructions.

\end{itemize}
The safe paths and restricted areas are pre-defined as per Dawlence requirement.

\section{Data Model (25 Points)}
\subsection{Database Design}
The system database manages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hazard Events and Data:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ensures scalability through an extensible Hazards Table, ensuring new hazards can be added without modifying exisiting relationships
        \item Records Hazard Detection with details such as timestamp, camera, hazard type, and alert status.
        \item Records additional data for certain Hazards, such as Speed and OperatorId for Forklifts and MachineId and OperatoId for Hydralic Press
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Data:} 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Stores user roles and permissions for secure system access.
    \item Stores Session Logs for additional security
    \item Keeps track of Notifications sent to users including timestamps for when the notification was sent, to who and with what details
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Worker Data}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Stores WorkerIds, Names and Jobtitles
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Camera Data}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Stores Important Camera infromation including IP-Address which would be required to access live footage
    \item Ensures Scalability for additional camera's which may be installed in different areas apart from the Steel Plate Workshop
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Video Metadata:}
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item Tracks file path and annotations for incident playback.
    \item Stores file path to clips of each Hazard
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Annotations}
The annotated data for the system includes the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PPE Compliance:}  
    This includes detecting compliance with safety equipment, such as gloves and shoes. Due to the variety of gloves used at Dawlence, the system will focus on detecting the presence of hands, implying the absence of gloves. For hand detection, the following dataset has been utilized:  
    \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/armannikkhah/hand-dataset/data}
    
    \item \textbf{Hazard Zones and Restricted Area Boundaries:}  
    This involves detecting individuals entering restricted zones. The current YOLOv8 models are capable of person detection without requiring fine-tuning. Restricted zones will be defined using pixel coordinates extracted from live footage of static cameras and correlated with real-world distance measurements.
    
    \item \textbf{Forklift Proximity and Speed:}  
    The system monitors forklifts for proximity to workers and speed violations. The dataset used for this functionality is currently under evaluation and integration.
    
    \item \textbf{Fall Detection:}  
    The system detects worker falls using a dataset sourced from the following repository:  
    \url{https://github.com/andmydignity/fall_detection_yolov8s}
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Pipeline}
\subsection{Training Data Pipeline}

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection:} CCTV footage and publicly available datasets. Publicly available datasets may need to be preprocessed and/or re-annotated.
    \item \textbf{Preprocessing:} Frame extraction, resizing, and augmentation.
    \item \textbf{Data annotation:} Annotate frames manually.
    \item \textbf{YOLO Model Training:} Transfer learning on annotated datasets.    
    \item \textbf{Post-Processing algorithms testing:} Contextual filtering to detect hazards based on relationship of detecteions. Experiment with different methods to find most accurate for our purpose.
    \item \textbf{Storage:} Privately stored recording of CCTV clips, annotated frames and associated data.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}
Below are the performance metrics for the Real-Time Safety Monitoring System:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Latency: The requirement of a maximum of 5 seconds for hazard detection and alert delivery is planned to be met using asynchronous processing for fast alert delivery, and for the detection part, we plan to use a combination approaches such as usage of optimized YOLO models, model quantization, etc.
    \item Accuracy: The requirement of 85\% minimum detection rate under standard conditions is planned to be met by using deep learning approaches such as addition in dataset using synthetic images generated from GANs, ensemblng, transfer learning, Data Augmentation, Knowledge Distillation, and other techniques.
    \item Frame Rate: We aim to achieve a minimum of 5 frames per second for real-time processing by techniques described in the section about latency optimization.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Features}
We will achieve sound safety protocols by having:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Encrypted communication between components for which we will develop secure APIs, and use HTTPS for web-based communication.
    \item Role-based access controls for user management.
    \item Multi-factor authentication for dashboard login.
    \item Regular security audits and penetration testing (using tools such as Vulert, OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, etc.).
\end{itemize}
